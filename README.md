# Motivation
I wanted to create this app because I've been using Google Keep as a workout list. 
I really liked having the list that removes the exercises I've done as I go along however, 
I wouldn't be able to see the past workouts I've done as well as my progress. 
I wanted to create something that has the ease of tapping away each exercise as 
I finish and have the flexibility to change the workouts as I go or do the exact same workout when I want to.
